qdod: Querying Disparate Oyster Datasets
====

This respository provides access to genomic data and workflows (IPython notebooks) that are being integrated as part of effort to increase effeciency of biological discovery. The **[wiki](https://github.com/sr320/qdod/wiki)** associated with this repository will serve as the _primary means for documentation_. Currently the documentation is focused on 1) **describing current datasets** and 2) **providing workflow tutorials**.


In brief, data in the form of delimited text files is aggregated into [SQLShare](https://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu/sqlshare/) where they can be easily queried. Below is schematic representation of the different types of datasets.

 During the initial phases the focus is on the Pacific oyster and primary data from the [Roberts Lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320).
